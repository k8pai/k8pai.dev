## 'this' Keyword in JavaScript

**Definition**: In JavaScript, the 'this' keyword refers to the context within which a function is executed. It is a special identifier that allows functions to access and manipulate properties and methods of the object it belongs to.

The value of 'this' is determined dynamically based on how a function is called. It can have different values depending on the invocation context:

- When a function is called as a method of an object, 'this' refers to the object itself.
- When a function is called as a standalone function, 'this' refers to the global object (usually the 'window' object in a browser environment).
- When a function is called with the 'new' keyword as a constructor, 'this' refers to the newly created instance.
- When a function is called using the 'call', 'apply', or 'bind' methods, 'this' can be explicitly set to any desired object.

### Examples

1. Method Invocation

```js
const person = {
	name: 'John',
	greet: function () {
		console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
	},
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John.
```

2. Standalone Function Invocation

```javascript
function sayHello() {
	console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
}

window.name = 'Alice';
sayHello(); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

3. Constructor Invocation

```javascript
function Person(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

const john = new Person('John');
console.log(john.name); // Output: John
```

4. Using 'call' or 'apply' Methods

```javascript
function greet() {
	console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
}

const person = { name: 'Alice' };
greet.call(person); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

Understanding the context and value of 'this' is crucial for properly accessing and manipulating object properties and achieving the desired behavior in JavaScript applications.

For more in-depth information, you can refer to the [MDN Web Docs on 'this'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this).
